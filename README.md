## Part 1: Bootstrap Grid
__Edit exercise.html for this portion of the lab__
1. Create a table layout **using bootrstrap grid** that includes 3 types of animals of your choice. The table layout should look similar to this **for all types of screens**: 

| Name       | Image  |
| ------------- | -----|
| Cat     | <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YCaGYUIfdy4/maxresdefault.jpg" width="350"> |
| Red Panda     | <img src="https://i.redd.it/0vbx9fw2hpd01.jpg" width="350"> |
| Dolphin     | <img src="https://i0.wp.com/funkidsjokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/dolphin-203875_960_720.jpg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1" width="350"> |
2. Show your work to an instructor or TA!

**Bonus**
Open the website you made then right click and inspect element. As you notice, the image isn't compatible with the screen size and can sometimes get out of the borders of the column that includes it. Google how to fix that. (hint: you need to make the image's width compatible with its parent)


## Part 2: Bootstrap Components

## Part 3: Bootstrap Calculator
__Edit calculator.html for this portion of the lab__
1. Open the calculator.html file in your browser (Chrome/ Firefox). What do you see?
2. You are right! it's the ugliest thing you've seen all day. You're job is to make it look more like a calculator
3. Using your knowledge about the Grid layout(rows, columns) and Bootstrap components (Buttons, inputs), make an interface for a calculator (out of inspiration? [click here](http://cdn.designrshub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/calculator-interface-designs-11.jpg) or [here](https://banner2.kisspng.com/20180325/ysq/kisspng-user-interface-design-calculator-dribbble-designer-calculator-5ab71f53c544c2.723624731521950547808.jpg))
4. The must haves for the calculator are, having buttons from 0-9, buttons for addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication, and textbox for showing the result

**Bonus**
To make this calculator work, we would need to use Javascript, which we will be learning soon! If you have time later, feel free to come back to this lab to make this calculator functional.
